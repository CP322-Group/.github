## 1. Project Overview
CP322 consists of three mini-projects/assignments designed to be completed in groups. Each of these assignments will be an opportunity for you to apply your knowledge and collaborate with your peers. Here's what you need to know:

## 2. Group Formation
- You are required to form groups of 4 to 5 members each to work collaboratively on the assignments.
- The designated group leader must email the TA the first and last names, student IDs, and emails of the group members. Each group will receive a unique GroupID on a first-come-first-served basis.

## 3. Group Leader Responsibilities
- The group leader is responsible for submitting the assignments on MyLearningSpace.
- Other group members should ensure that their group leader submits the assignments on time.

## 4. Assignment Details
- The specifics of the assignments will be posted on MyLearningSpace in the Dropbox folder at least two weeks before the due dates.
- The due date of the assignments and further instructions will also be announced.
  
## 5. Submission Guidelines
- You are required to submit two files for each assignment:
  - `code.zip`: Your data processing and evaluation code (e.g., .py and .ipynb files).
  - `writeup.pdf`: Your project write-up, limited to a maximum of 5 pages.
- Ensure that your PDF contains:
  - A cover page
  - Page numbers
  - A header with your GroupID, course code, submission date, and assignment number on each page.

## 6. Late Submissions
- Late assignment submissions will be penalized 20% and will not be accepted after passing five days from the due dates.

## 7. Assignment File Naming
- Please use the following naming schemes for your .zip and .pdf files:
  - `CP322-A1-GroupID` (for assignment 1)
  - `CP322-A2-GroupID` (for assignment 2)
  - `CP322-A3-GroupID` (for assignment 3); please use dashes, not underscores.

## 8. Project Presentation
- Be prepared to present one of the mini-projects, with a focus on the 3rd one, in the last week of the classes.

## 9. Project Write-up Requirements
Your team must submit a project write-up that adheres to the following guidelines:
- The write-up should be a maximum of five pages (single-spaced, 11pt font or larger; minimum 0.5-inch margins).
- An extra page can be used for references/bibliographical content.
- We highly recommend using LaTeX to complete your write-ups.

## 10. Evaluation Criteria
Your assignments will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. **Completeness (3 points)**
   - Did you submit all the required materials?
   - Did you run all the necessary experiments?
   - Did you follow the guidelines for the project write-up?

2. **Correctness (4 points)**
   - Are your models implemented and applied correctly?
   - Are your reported accuracies close to the reference solutions?
   - Do your proposed features improve performance, or do you adequately demonstrate that it was not possible to improve performance?
   - Do you observe the correct trends in the experiments?

3. **Writing Quality (2 points)**
   - Is your report clear and free of grammatical errors and typos?
   - Did you go beyond the bare minimum requirements for the write-up (e.g., by including a discussion of related work in the introduction)?
   - Did you effectively present numerical results (e.g., via tables or figures)?

4. **Originality/Creativity (1 point)**
   - Did you go beyond the bare minimum requirements for the experiments? For example, you could investigate different hyperparameters, different feature extractions, combining different models, etc., to achieve better performance.

5. **Best Performance Bonus (1 point)**
   - The top-performing group (groups, if there are ties) will receive a bonus conditioned that they are better than the TAâ€™s baseline. This is based on the performance of the test set provided with the data, which is not supposed to be used during the training of your models. Any choice of hyperparameters should be explained to ensure that information in the test set is not being used.

We hope this readme clarifies the group organization and project requirements for your CP322 mini-projects. Should you have any questions or need further information, don't hesitate to reach out to your TA or the course instructor.

Happy collaborating and best of luck with your assignments!
